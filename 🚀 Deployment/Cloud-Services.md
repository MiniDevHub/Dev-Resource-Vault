## 💡 MrDib's Cloud Strategy

</div>

### Choosing Your Cloud Provider

**AWS**: If you need the widest service selection and most mature ecosystem.

**GCP**: If you're focused on data analytics, machine learning, or Kubernetes.

**Azure**: If you're in an enterprise with existing Microsoft investments.

**Multi-Cloud**: Some companies use multiple providers for redundancy or to leverage each provider's strengths. Complex but resilient.

### My Personal Stack

- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Railway (backend)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (file uploads)
- **CDN**: Cloudflare
- **Monitoring**: Sentry (errors), Vercel Analytics (frontend)

### For Learning

Start with **AWS** or **GCP** free tiers. Get hands-on experience. Certifications help but practical experience matters more.

### Cloud Certifications Worth Pursuing

- **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate**
- **Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect**
- **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate**
