## 💡 MrDib's Learning Strategy

</div>

### The 4-Step Process

```

1. Get the Big Picture

   - Watch a quick overview video (Fireship.io)
   - Read a "what is X?" article
   - Understand the "why" before the "how"

2. Learn the Fundamentals

   - Interactive course (Codecademy, Scrimba)
   - Official docs (MDN, React.dev)
   - Read a comprehensive guide (Eloquent JavaScript)

3. Build Something (Apply Knowledge)

   - Clone a project
   - Follow a tutorial to build a small app
   - Solve a coding challenge (Exercism, LeetCode)
   - Start a personal project (most effective!)

4. Dive Deeper / Optimize
   - Read advanced articles (Smashing Magazine, CSS-Tricks)
   - Watch expert talks (YouTube)
   - Refactor your own code
   - Help others (explaining solidifies understanding)

```

### Effective Learning Habits

- **Consistency**: Little every day beats binge-learning.
- **Active Recall**: Don't just re-read, try to explain.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Revisit topics over time.
- **Teach Others**: Best way to learn is to teach.
- **Take Notes**: Digital (Obsidian) or physical.
- **Breaks**: Step away to let information sink in.
- **Experiment**: Break things, fix them.
