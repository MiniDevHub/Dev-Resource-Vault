## 🎯 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

</div>

### Don't Fall Into These Traps ⚠️

```

❌ Only solving easy problems (comfort zone trap)
❌ Not understanding solutions (just memorizing)
❌ Skipping contests (fear of failure)
❌ Comparing yourself to others (your own pace matters)
❌ Not timing yourself (interview pressure practice)
❌ Giving up too quickly (struggle = growth)
❌ Ignoring time/space complexity analysis
❌ Not reviewing solved problems

✅ Instead, Do This:

- Push yourself with harder problems
- Understand WHY solutions work
- Participate in contests for experience
- Track your personal progress
- Practice under time constraints
- Struggle for 30 mins before looking at hints
- Always analyze complexity
- Review problems after 1 week, 1 month

```
